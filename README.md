# Cory Young: Data Analysis Portfolio

## About me
Hello! My name is Cory Young. I am passionate about finding data-driven solutions that can improve efficiency while considering the potential impact on front-line operations, where relevant. I bring over 5 years of leadership experience with a proven track record of building successful teams.

The goal of this repository is to showcase skills, share projects, and track my growth as a Data Analyst/Data Scientist.

Outside of professional development, some of my hobbies include: Playing and coaching hockey, working out, and painting miniatures!
